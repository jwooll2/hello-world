# hello-world
this is my first GitHub repository
I am starting out to learn to program at age of 44.  Starting with HTML, CSS, JS for Front End Dev to do freelance work the last 20 yrs of my working career.  All the while learning WordPress, PHP and some Python to expand my brain since I have never seen myself as a creative thinker.  More Analytical.
